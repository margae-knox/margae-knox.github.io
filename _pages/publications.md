### Defining case management success: a qualitative study of case manager perspectives from a large-scale health and social needs support program

As case management programs proliferate, there is mixed evidence about program success. Traditionally, success is measured by the use of costly health services like hospital and emergency department visits. In this paper we investigate alternative defitions of success from the perspective of case managers. Case managers idenified establishing trust, a change in patient mindset and initiative, and patient stability and independence as key indicators of success. Case managers also emphaisized the importance of patient-defined success and individualized, incremental goals.

### Maslach burnout inventory and a self-defined, single-item burnout measure produce different clinician and staff burnout estimates

Burnout is a pervasive concern across healthcare professions. In this paper, we identify that two commonly used burnout measurements yield starkly different results in the same population. For example, 52% of clinicians report burnout based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory while 29% report burnout based on a self-defined, single-item question. Both measures demonstrate concurrent validity but are not interchangeable. These findings are important for researchers, health systems, and leaders working to evaluate and improve burnout in their own settings and who want to compare results across settings.
