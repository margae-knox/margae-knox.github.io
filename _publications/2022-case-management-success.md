excerpt: 'As case management programs proliferate, there is mixed evidence about program success. Traditionally, success is measured by the use of costly health services like hospital and emergency department visits. In this paper we investigate alternative defitions of success from the perspective of case managers. Case managers idenified establishing trust, a change in patient mindset and initiative, and patient stability and independence as key indicators of success. Case managers also emphaisized the importance of patient-defined success and individualized, incremental goals.
