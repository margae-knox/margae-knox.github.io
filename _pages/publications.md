## Defining case management success: a qualitative study of case manager perspectives from a large-scale health and social needs support program

As case management programs proliferate, success is traditionally measured by decreases in costly hospital and emergency department visits. In this paper we investigate alternative defitions of success from the perspective of case managers. Case managers identified establishing trust, a change in a patient's mindset or initiative, and patient stability and independence as key indicators of success. Case managers also emphaisized the importance of patient-defined success and individualized, incremental goals.

## Maslach burnout inventory and a self-defined, single-item burnout measure produce different clinician and staff burnout estimates

Burnout is a pervasive concern across healthcare professions. In this paper, we identify how two commonly used burnout measurements yield starkly different results. For example, in the same population, 52% of clinicians reported burnout based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory while 29% reported burnout based on a self-defined, single-item question. Both measures demonstrate concurrent validity but they are not interchangeable. These findings are important for researchers, health systems, and leaders working to evaluate and improve burnout in their own settings and who want to compare results across settings.
